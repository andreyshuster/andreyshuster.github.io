Hey there, I'm Andrey, DevOps specialist and programmer with passion
for all things tech, especially cybersecurity and automating things.

My journey has been one of autodidacticism â€“ an odyssey of
self-directed learning and practical experience. My foundation was not
laid in the traditional confines of a classroom, but rather through a
curiosity and desire to unravel the complexities of computers.

I am a big fan of classic science fiction like Isaac Asimov's
"Foundation", "The Futurological Congress" by Stanislaw Lem or "The
Moon is a Harsh Mistress" by Robert Heinlein.

When I was 35, I started running and I am running a couple times a
week. Never run marathon yet, but did few half marathons and a lot of
10k and 5k races.

Since English is not my native language, I occasionally make
grammatical mistakes. To help translate my text, I use AI
tools like ChatGPT and Claude.AI.
