Hey there, I'm Andrey, DevOps specialist and programmer with passion for all things tech, especially cybersecurity and automating things.

My journey has been one of autodidacticism â€“ an odyssey of self-directed learning and practical experience. My foundation was not laid in the traditional confines of a classroom, but rather through a curiosity and desire to unravel the complexities of computers.

I am a big fan of classic science fiction like Isaac Asimov's "Foundation", "The Futurological Congress" by Stanislaw Lem or "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" by Robert Heinlein.

When I was 35, I started running. Never run marathon yet, but did few half marathons and a lot of 10k and 5k races.
