> When writing an SQL query, you start with `SELECT` and then `FROM`
  because it resembles human language: first, you say what you want to
  get (for example, a list of names), and then you specify where to
  get this data from (from the participants table). It's easier to
  remember and formulate this way, although all programmers agree that
  it would be better the other way around — `FROM ... SELECT`.

When I started programming professionally, I somehow decided that
knowing SQL wasn't necessary at all. For complex questions, there were
DBAs, and for simple ones, there were ORMs. SQL seemed too arcane,
evoking images of mainframes and punch cards. Then, various NoSQL
solutions from CouchDB to MongoDB gained popularity, and I happily
switched to document-oriented databases, once again mistakenly
deciding that SQL was outdated and not worth my time. A few years
later, I evolved into a DevOps and SRE specialist and concluded that I
would never need SQL...

Time and experience, of course, proved me wrong. Now, I have to write
and analyze SQL queries every day. SQL is used in BigQuery, AWS
Athena, Cloudwatch Metrics Insights, and even Grafana. With SQL, you
can quickly obtain almost any historical and current information about
events in the infrastructure.

In short, I've grown older and wiser and finally concluded that SQL is
the most essential skill for anyone (not just coders) who works with
computers. It's like ancient magic—not needed by everyone all the
time, it looks strange and verbose, but it provides a huge advantage
when it comes to analyzing and obtaining specific data.

Not to mention, a kind of SQL (DQL) is used in the Dataview plugin in
Obsidian, where I'm writing this text. It's amusing to see how "old"
technologies repeatedly prove their effectiveness despite loud and
premature declarations of their demise.
