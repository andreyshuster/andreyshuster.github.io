My journey has been one of autodidacticism – an odyssey of self-directed learning and practical experience. My foundation was not laid in the traditional confines of a classroom, but rather through a curiosity and desire to unravel the complexities of computers.
I am a big fan of classic science fiction like Isaac Asimov&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Foundation&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Futurological Congress&amp;rdquo; by Stanislaw Lem or &amp;ldquo;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&amp;rdquo; by Robert Heinlein.</description></item></channel></rss>
